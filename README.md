# Assignment 1: A1 SimpleList
## Author: Austin Nelson
## Class: CS 402 Section 001

### Project Description: 
A program with simple list functionalities for adding, removing, joining and splitting elements. There is also
a reset function that will restore the list to its original state. There is a bank of scientist names which are the 
ones that get added to the seen list when the add button is pressed. Along with the names, each entry also has an
user id associated with it. The id is not shown but is in the source code if it wanted to be added. 

### Reflection:
Overall, I actually found this assignment to be quite fun. I really enjoy learning new languages and I have never
worked with Javascript before (as well as React frameworks) so that process was enjoyable to me. Granted, there were
a lot of things I had to look up because I wasn't familiar with any list functions and just what was possible.
Furthermore, I thought the way states work was interesting and is a new concept to me. I never really thought about
variables working like that, where they have an element you change and it updates the entire list. Another note
about this assignment that I enjoyed was the open ended aspect to it; there weren't many constrictions on what our app
had to be like, which left for a lot of creativity. I feel like in some of my other projects for classes, there is 
such a strict guideline that it leaves little room for creativity and adding my own twist to it. Overall, I really
enjoyed this project and I am looking forward to the next React assignment.
